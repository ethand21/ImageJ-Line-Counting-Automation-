# ImageJ-Line-Counting-Automation-
Output a graph with the line tool from Image J. Plot the grayscale values, import the graph file, and set the grayscale value threshold. Then the program will count how many times that threshold was crossed. This can be used to automate counting how old barnacles are using growth lines. This is being included in a USGS research paper.
